## Contact PyBaMM

There are a few ways to get in touch, whether it is through reporting bugs,
requesting features, asking for help, or just saying hello!

### Bug reports and feature requests

To submit bug reports or feature requests, please go to our
[GitHub issue tracker](https://www.github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/issues).
We will always appreciate these contributions and feedback!

### Technical questions

To get support with technical questions, please use the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/discussions). When opening a post, check first if your question has been asked and answered before. It will be much easier for other members of our community to help you if you can provide details about the operating system and PyBaMM version you are using, and include a minimal working example. That is a short snippet of code, as simple as possible, that demonstrates the issue you are facing. Please do not contact individual maintainers directly for support.

### Slack

For development discussions and to get help using PyBaMM, head over to our
[Slack workspace](https://pybamm.org/slack/).
If the link doesn't work, you can email us at [pybamm@pybamm.org](mailto:pybamm@pybamm.org) for an invitation.

### General inquiries

For general inquiries, other than topics listed above, you can contact us by emailing [pybamm@pybamm.org](mailto:pybamm@pybamm.org).
