{{< buttons/github-star >}}{{< buttons/github-fork >}}

PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) is an open-source battery simulation package written in Python. Our mission is to accelerate battery modelling research by providing open-source tools for multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration.

Broadly, PyBaMM consists of

1. A framework for writing and solving systems of differential equations
2. A library of battery models and parameters, and
3. Specialized tools for simulating battery-specific experiments and visualizing the results.

Together, these enable flexible model definitions and fast battery simulations, allowing users to explore the effect of different battery designs and modeling assumptions under a variety of operating scenarios.

If you like PyBaMM, please consider starring us on GitHub and spreading the word! You can also fork the repository to add your own models. For information about
donations and how you can support, please see the [Donate](/donate/) page.

## Institutional Partners

### Ionworks

[Ionworks](https://ionworks.com/) is a company founded by members of the PyBaMM core development team to ensure [PyBaMM's long-term success](https://ionworks.com/blog/our-relationship-with-pybamm).
Ionworks provides support and custom feature development for PyBaMM, as well as software to make modeling easier and faster.
For companies who want to leverage the power, flexibility, and openness of the Python ecosystem for their battery simulation needs, Ionworks is the go-to partner.

### Google Summer of Code

Since 2021, the [Google Summer of Code](/gsoc/) programme has provided funding for 6 students to spend a summer working on a PyBaMM project; we are pleased to say that several of these have gone on to become long-time PyBaMM contributors!

### Other partners

We are grateful to the following organizations for supporting PyBaMM's development, either directly through employee/student time or indirectly through financial support:
