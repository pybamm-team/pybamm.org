# April Fools! ðŸŽ‰

There isn't really a PyBaMM premium. And there aren't any ads either. You can enjoy PyBaMM for free forever - that's the beauty of open source!

## Supporting PyBaMM

While PyBaMM will always be free and open source, if you'd like to support the project's development and sustainability, here are some ways you can help:

### Ionworks

[Ionworks](https://ionworks.com/) is a company founded by members of the PyBaMM core development team to ensure PyBaMM's long-term success.

For organizations needing premium simulation software and professional support, you can work with Ionworks to get premium features such as:
- Running no-code simulations in the cloud
- Model parameterization
- Custom model development
- [PyBaMM training](https://www.ionworks.com/training)
- Professional support and consulting

### GitHub Sponsors

You can sponsor PyBaMM through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/pybamm-team). Your sponsorship helps fund:
