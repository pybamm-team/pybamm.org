PyBaMM has come a long way thanks to its vibrant community of users and contributors. As we look ahead, we want to make sure PyBaMM continues to grow in ways that best serve the battery modelling community. To do that, we need your input.

Please take a few minutes to fill out our [user questionnaire](https://forms.gle/LYW6YPi3xZ8XGYAM8). Whether you're a regular user, an occasional visitor, or someone who’s considered using PyBaMM but hasn’t yet, your feedback is incredibly valuable.

## Why are we doing this?
Over the past few years, PyBaMM has evolved into a key tool for battery researchers around the world. As the community grows, so does the need to ensure that PyBaMM remains sustainable, responsive to user needs, and impactful in the long term.

We’re conducting this questionnaire to better understand:

1. Who is using PyBaMM and how they’re using it.
2. Why some researchers choose not to use PyBaMM, and what barriers they face.
3. Whether organisations might be interested in supporting PyBaMM financially, helping us secure the resources needed for continued development.
4. The broader impact PyBaMM is having on battery research, which is essential for attracting public and private funding.


## What kind of information are we collecting?
The questionnaire focuses on three key areas:

1. Your experience with PyBaMM – how you use it, or why you don’t.
2. Potential financial support – whether your organisation might be interested in contributing financially to PyBaMM’s development.
3. Follow-up contact – whether we can reach out to learn more about your use of PyBaMM.

You can complete the questionnaire completely anonymously. Any identifying information (such as your name or organisation) is entirely optional and will only be used with your permission.

## What will we do with the results?
We’ll analyse the responses to identify trends, challenges, and opportunities. Your feedback will directly inform future development priorities, feature improvements, and community engagement efforts. We also plan to share a summary of the results in a future blog post. All data will be aggregated and anonymised to protect your privacy.

Thank you for helping us make PyBaMM better for everyone. Take the [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/LYW6YPi3xZ8XGYAM8) now – it only takes a few minutes, and your input will make a real difference.
