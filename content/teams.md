beyond just code (ideas, bug reports, adding documentation, maintenance, examples, and more).

For viewing various types of contributions (financial support, bug reports, ideas), see the [PyBaMM repository](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM#-contributors) on GitHub.
Contributions of any kind are welcome!
