## Installation instructions

PyBaMM is available on the `pip` package manager for Windows, macOS, and Linux; and can be installed with

```bash
pip install pybamm
```

More detailed instructions for installing PyBaMM on different platforms and for installing from source can be found in the [installation instructions](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/user_guide/installation/index.html) in the documentation.

## Example notebooks

If you would like to get started with PyBaMM, you may go through the [Getting Started notebooks](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/develop/examples/) which introduce its basic features. You can launch the notebooks on Google Colab to run them on the cloud without having to install PyBaMM on your computer.
