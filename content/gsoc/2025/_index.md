<!--  ## Adding type hints to PyBaMM models

PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) has evolved significantly since 2019 as a framework for battery modeling applications. While the focus on performance optimization has led to impressive speed improvements across PyBaMM and the time taken from conducting an experiment to its industrial impact, it has introduced complexity that can make code validation and maintenance challenging. This project aims to systematically introduce static typing to PyBaMM's codebase, particularly focusing on the `pybamm.models` component and surrounding areas, to enhance code safety and improve the developer experience.

The current lack of type hints in PyBaMM creates several challenges. Silent failures in the validation of model arguments often only surface at runtime, making debugging difficult and time-consuming. New contributors frequently struggle to understand the expected input and output types for functions and methods, leading to a steeper learning curve. This absence also limits IDE support for code completion and error detection, making model development less efficient for researchers. Additionally, maintaining API consistency across different parts of the API becomes more challenging without clear type definitions, and numerical operations can fail unexpectedly due to unclear data type expectations.

Hence, this project seeks to implement a comprehensive typing system to improve PyBaMM's codebase. By enhancing code reliability through static type checking, we can catch errors earlier in the development process. The addition of clear type signatures will serve as implicit documentation, making the codebase more accessible to new contributors. This improvement in tooling support will accelerate development workflows and make maintenance and refactoring tasks more manageable. Furthermore, the typing system will facilitate better integration with downstream scientific libraries that rely on PyBaMM, such as PyBOP and other upcoming projects.

The scope could be expanded to include more sophisticated items towards a stretch goal if time permits. This might include creating separate type stub files for improved modularity, developing custom types for battery-specific validation, and extending type coverage to additional modules beyond the core models.

### Technical details

The implementation of the typing system will require careful evaluation of different approaches by the student, and they can explore either inline type hints in existing code, or separate `.pyi` stub files for backward compatibility, or the creation of a standalone `pybamm-stubs` package, or potentially a hybrid approach combining multiple methods. Each approach has its own trade-offs in terms of maintenance burden, backward compatibility, and ease of implementation â€“ the student is expected to survey the existing strategy adopted by Scientific Python libraries and choose the most suitable approach for PyBaMM.

Previously, type hints were added to the expression tree via [pybamm-team/pybamm#3578](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/issues/3578), which can serve as a reference for the student.

The type system design will require particular attention to several key areas. The student may need to create custom types for battery-specific parameters, ensuring they accurately represent the domain concepts. The system must handle NumPy array types and dimensional analysis effectively, define clear type hierarchies for different battery models, and manage type compatibility with scientific computing libraries. The implementation of generic types for flexible model arguments will also prove to be essential for maintaining the PyBaMM framework's versatility.

### Expected outcomes

- Type system architecture: documentation of typing strategy and conventions, type hierarchy design for battery models, integration plan with existing codebase

- Implementation: type hints for core pybamm.models API, custom type definitions for battery-specific components as needed, a short migration guide for adding types to other modules

- Validation: CI integration with type checkers (Mypy, Pyright, basedmypy) as pre-commit hooks, documentation for type checking workflow and updates to the contributing guide

- Documentation: Updated API documentation with type information, and a guide for downstream libraries on utilizing type information provided by PyBaMM

### Desired skills

- Some experience with static typing in Python is beneficial, but not required.
- Python programming experience, Git version control, and GitHub workflow for open-source projects
- An affinity for reading lots of code and documentation
- An interest in scientific computing and battery modeling (prior experience not required)
- As a plus, knowledge on how to use scientific computing libraries (NumPy, SciPy)
- Some understanding of continuous integration providers (GitHub Actions, etc.) is beneficial, but not required.

### Difficulty

**Easy**. This project is suitable for a 175-hour duration.

## Adding a spirally wound geometry for thermal simulations in PyBaMM

With the increasing demand for high-performance batteries, accurate thermal modeling of battery behavior is essential. A key challenge is the interaction between electrochemical and thermal dynamics in complicated battery geometries, which affects performance, safety, and lifespan. This project aims to develop a framework for the addition of coupled electrochemical-thermal simulations in PyBaMM in higher-dimensional geometries (e.g. cylindrical)

This project aims to couple the electrochemical models already available in PyBaMM, such as the SPM or DFN, with a higher-dimensional thermal model. As a proof of concept, the model will be used to simulate temperature distributions throughout the cell under different operating conditions.

As a first step, a 3D thermal model will be implemented in PyBaMM with a constant heat source term. This will require adding new 3D meshes and spatial methods to PyBaMM (ideally by adding an existing 3D Finite Volume package as a dependency, such as Gmsh, Meshlib, Salome, etc). Next, this thermal model will be coupled with an electrochemical model, which will provide the heat source term. Finally, the coupling will be made two-way so that the lumped temperature from the 3D model feeds back into the electrochemical model.

As a stretch goal, the project will explore the integration of 3D temperature profiles obtained from the spirally wound 3D thermal model back into the electrochemical model. This would enable feedback coupling, where the electrochemical model depends on the temperature distribution of the 3D model, providing a foundation for more complex coupling strategies in future research.

### Expected outcomes

The expected outcome of this study is a proof-of-concept 3D thermal model implemented in PyBaMM, along with the necessary meshing and discretization capabilities. It includes a computational framework for electrochemical-thermal coupling on new cell geometries, and the implementation of a spirally wound geometry for thermal simulations in PyBaMM.

### Desired skills

- Python programming experience, Git version control, and GitHub workflow for open-source projects
- An interest in scientific computing and battery modeling
- Experience with numerical methods for solving differential equations
- Experience with meshing libraries (e.g. Finite Volumes or Finite Elements) is desirable but not required
- As a plus, knowledge of how to use scientific computing libraries (NumPy, SciPy, SUNDIALS)

### Difficulty

**Hard**. This project is suitable for a 350-hour duration.

## Open project idea(s)

We are also open to the inclusion of open project ideas for PyBaMM and candidates are encouraged to propose their own projects, if they feel at any time that our idea list does not currently cater to their interests and passions. If you have a project idea that you think would be beneficial to PyBaMM and its community, please feel free to reach out to us on our [Slack workspace](https://pybamm.org/slack/) in the `#gsoc-main` channel.

The project should be validated by getting in touch with potential mentors early, publicly, to ensure that its goals are realistic and within the scope of PyBaMM's roadmap, i.e., the project should also be beneficial to the PyBaMM community and should be able to be completed within the GSoC timeline.

The requirements for the inclusion of said project must include:

- A mentor within the PyBaMM maintainers team and the greater community who would be available and willing to support the project with code reviews, frequent meetings decided at a time with you during the coding period, and by offering general guidance and feedback within the scope of mentorship.
- A clear project description, including the expected outcomes, the technical details, the desired skills, and the difficulty level of the project, similar to the project ideas listed on this page.
- Proposed project length and timeline, including milestones and deliverables, which should be clearly defined and agreed upon by the mentor and the student (you). It should be either a **175-hour** or **350-hour** project, and not any other duration.
