# Projects

* [Documentation](#documentation)
* [Techno-economic analysis](#techno-economic-analysis)
* [Dockerizing and simplifying PyBaMM's installation](#dockerizing-and-simplifying-pybamms-installation)

## Documentation

Our documentation is currently fragmented across several different locations:
* The readme on GitHub
* Our website, pybamm.org, contains generic information about the project
* API docs + a fledgling user guide on [readthedocs](https://pybamm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Example notebooks on [GitHub](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/latest/source/examples/index.html)
* Some information here on GitHub Wiki

The goal of this project is to consolidate all of the information together under a single location.
* Create a new website using Hugo's scientific python theme (see [#2639](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/issues/2639)). This should contain the same content as the current version of pybamm.org (the pybamm.org URL will be reassigned to this page)
* Link docs.pybamm.org to our readthedocs API docs and user guide (it might make sense to move the user guide out)
* Move information from this wiki page to the website
* Use nbconvert (or other) to run and display static versions of the jupyter notebooks on the website; also use [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) to clear the output of notebooks in version control

As a stretch goal, the student will be expected to survey other popular python packages for ideas on how to improve our documentation infrastructure. Some ideas are:
* Using sphinxcontrib-bibtex to print references from bibtex instead of hardcoding them in docstrings as we currently do
* Dependency trees
* In the API docs, link to examples where various functionality is used (scikit-learn)

Note that the focus of this project is not on writing documentation but on improving the infrastructure around it.

### Expected outcomes
* All documentation in one place
* As much automation as possible to make maintaining and updating documentation easy

### Desired skills

* Basic python and markdown knowledge
* Basic web development knowledge would be helpful but not required (html + css)
* Hosting documentation on Sphinx
* Git version control, CI, testing

### Difficulty
* Medium. This project is suitable for a 350h project.

### Potential mentors
* [Robert Timms](https://github.com/rtimms)
* [Valentin Sulzer](https://github.com/valentinsulzer)
* [Saransh Chopra](https://github.com/Saransh-cpp)
* [Priyanshu Agarwal](https://github.com/priyanshuone6)

## Techno-economic analysis

While PyBaMM goes deep into advanced models of batteries, much can be done with simpler "back-of-the-envelope" calculations for the capacity, energy, mass, and cost of a battery. The goal of this project will be to create a library for techno-economic analysis that can be combined with existing PyBaMM functionality. This project will draw inspiration from existing libraries (https://github.com/mjlacey/cellmodels, https://github.com/ndrewwang/BotB). See those repositories for more detail on what the outcome might look like.

### Expected outcomes
* A library for techno-economic analysis that can be combined with existing PyBaMM functionality

### Desired skills

* Strong python skills, particularly ability to construct user-friendly APIs
* Knowledge of basic battery concepts (capacity, resistance, energy, electrodes, etc)
* Git version control, CI, testing

### Difficulty
* Medium. This project is suitable for a 175h project.

### Potential mentors
* [Robert Timms](https://github.com/rtimms)
* [Valentin Sulzer](https://github.com/valentinsulzer)

## Dockerizing and simplifying PyBaMM's installation

PyBaMM currently has multiple required and optional dependencies, but the installation process for some of them is not straightforward. PyBaMM depends on `tox` to unify the installation process at the moment, but Dockerizing the process (without removing the `tox` dependency) will make it uniform for every platform and developer. The goal of this project would be to make PyBaMM's developer installation, with optional as well as default dependencies, a breeze. Ideally, in the end, developers will be able to install PyBaMM (with specific dependencies chosen by them) using a single command.

### Expected outcomes
* A new installation process using Docker. Related issue - [#1926](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/issues/1926).
* A better installation guide (for all installation processes, platforms, and popular package managers).
* CI for testing different installation processes of PyBaMM.
* DockerHub support and CI (synced with PyBaMM's releases) for uploading container images to the same.

Other possible issues/PRs that can be tackled - [#2457](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/issues/2457), [#2346](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/issues/2346), [#2537](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2537).

Stretch goals:

* Providing Docker support for running the example notebooks.
* Docker images to install PyBaMM with specific optional dependencies chosen by a developer.
* Uploading separate Docker images (each mapping to different optional dependencies) to DockerHub with CI support (synced with PyBaMM's releases).

### Desired skills

* Basic knowledge of DevOps tools and platforms - Docker, DockerHub, CI (GitHub Actions), Shell Scripting, etc.
* Some knowledge/experience in packaging and building Python libraries.
* Git version control.

### Difficulty
* Medium. This project is suitable for a 350h project.
